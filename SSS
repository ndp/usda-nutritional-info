The Governance Committee and Charles Levin unanimously recommend the establishment of a board finance committee.

This committee will consist of at least two board members, including the treasurer. Initial members of this board committee would be the treasurer, Michael Lessin, Charles Levin, Andrew Peterson, and Linda Johnson.

The committee shall determine their own meeting schedule.

The Finance Committee tasks are: 
*   To review financial statements of the organization as appropriate.
*	To work with staff to design financial reports and ensure that reports are accurate and timely 
*   To report the financial status to the Board at each Board meeting. 
*	To report to the board any financial irregularities, concerns, opportunities 
*   To develop, with the executive director, a budget for the organization based on forecasted income and expenses. 
*   To help develop appropriate procedures for budget preparations (such as meaningful involvement by program directors), and on a consistency between the budget and the organization's plans 
*	To recommend financial guidelines to the board
*	To oversee and stewart short and long-term investments, and develop long-term financial plans and strategies
*	To recommend selection of the auditor and work with the auditor, unless there is a separate audit committee, and 
*	To advise the executive director and other appropriate staff on financial priorities and information systems, depending on committee member expertise. 
*   To review all grants and contracts regarding their fiscal implications for the organization.

A separate, but equally important goal:

*	To improve the committee's, and the whole organization's, knowledge of non-profit financial management. The executive director, and this commmittee, will develop a plan to achieve this through training, advisors, consultants or other strategies.
